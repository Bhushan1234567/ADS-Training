<!--A block-level element always starts on a new line, 
    and the browsers automatically add some
     space (a margin) before and after the element.
 
     The <div> element is often used as a container for
     other HTML elements.

        <h3> What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
        <p class = "firstp blackp"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
